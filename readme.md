#SCARLET
###Speech Computing and Realistic Life Enhancement Technology

**SCARLET** is yet another speech interface made for Android devices, however the intention is to make it significantly different to current apps.

Current:
- When "Send" is clicked, the contents of the text box are added to the message log and spoken via TTS.

In Progress:
- Authenticating against a Google account on the device (for App Engine integration later)

To Do:
- [ ] Setting up the App Engine connection
- [ ] Local service to sync with App Engine and respond to push notifications
- [ ] Extend settings menu
- [ ] Add message log
- [ ] Integrate with system notifications
- [ ] Too many possibilities to list
